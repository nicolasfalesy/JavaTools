# Java Tools
These are some extra tools for java that you can easily incorporate into your projects

## Contents
 - Checking if an integer or double is valid
 - Easy random number generator
 - Text that prints on the screen nicely

### Why?
 - Using java, there are a lot of things that I wish I could do but are not already built in features, so I just created them myself.
 - I like to make my own things, and it's easier to understand exactly how it works if I just do it myself
